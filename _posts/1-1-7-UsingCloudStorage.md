# Using Cloud Storage
<hr />

Shoutem Cloud Storage is a CMS solution for mobile apps. It is optimized to be used within React Native apps with premade `reducers` and `actions` that are available in `@shoutem/redux-io` package. To describe model of your data on Shoutem Cloud Storage, you need to define a `Data Schema`:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem schema add Restaurants
File `server/data-schemas/Restaurants.json` is created.
```

Folder `schemas` inside `server` folder was created with file `Restaurants.json`. Content of that file is following:

```JSON
#file: server/data-schemas/Restaurants.json
{
  "title": "Restaurants"
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "format": "single-line",
      "title": "Name",
      "type": "string"
    },
  },
  "titleProperty": "name",
  "type": "object"
}
```

This is for the first time that we used `server` folder for something. The reason is that data-schemas are not part of the application code, but rather server side for extension. Data Schemas are nothing more than Shoutem-flavored [JSON Schemas](http://json-schema.org/). At the end, there are some properties describing the schema itself.

This schema was immediately exported in `extension.json` file:

```JSON{17-20}
#file: extension.json
{
  "name": "restaurants",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "title": "Restaurants",
  "description": "List of restaurants",
  "shortcuts": [{
    "name": "openRestaurantsList",
    "title": "Restaurants",
    "description": "Allow users to browse through list of restaurants"
    "screen": "@.RestaurantsList",
  }],
  "screens": [{
    "name": "RestaurantsList"
  }, {
    "name": "RestaurantDetails"
  }],
  "dataSchemas": [{
    "name": "Restaurants",
    "path": "server/schemas/Restaurants.json"
  }]
}
```

Let's add now properties that we want to persist for a restaurant, such as: `name`, `address`, `description`, `url`, `image` and `mail`.

```JSON{3-33}
#file: server/data-schemas/Restaurants.json
{
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "format": "single-line",
      "title": "Restaurant name",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "address": {
      "format": "single-line",
      "title": "Address",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "description": {
      "format": "multi-line",
      "title": "Description",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "url": {
      "format": "uri",
      "title": "Website",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "image": {
      "format": "attachment",
      "title": "Image",
      "type": "object",
      "referencedSchema": "shoutem.core.image-attachments"
    },
    "mail": {
      "format": "single-line",
      "title": "E-mail",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "title": "Restaurant",
  "titleProperty": "name",
  "type": "object"
}
```

Now in order to enter data for your schema, you need to link your extension with Shoutem CMS admin page. Shortly, **Admin Pages** are web pages that you as developer can write to allow admin to manage your extension. They are shown inside Shoutem builder when admin clicks on the shortcut. In this example weâ€™re using predefined Shoutem CMS admin page. Add Admin Page to `openRestaurantsList` shortcut and specify for which Data Schema you want to enter the data:

```JSON{11-17}
#file: extension.json
{
  "name": "restaurants",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "title": "Restaurants",
  "description": "List of restaurants",
  "navItems": [{
    "name": "openRestaurantsList",
    "title": "Restaurants",
    "description": "Allow users to browse through list of restaurants"
    "screen": "@.RestaurantsList",
    "adminPages": [{
      "page": "shoutem.admin.CmsPage",
      "title": "Content",
      "parameters": {
        "schema": "@.Restaurants"
      }
    }]
  }],
  "screens": [{
    "name": "RestaurantsList"
  }, {
    "name": "RestaurantDetails"
  }],
  "dataSchemas": [{
    "name": "Restaurants",
    "path": "server/schemas/Restaurants.json"
  }]
}
```

Upload the extension:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

Go to `Shoutem Builder`. There you can see an empty admin page which allows you to add restaurants.

<p class="image">
<img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/img/getting-started/empty-admin-page.jpg'/>
</p>

Click on `Create content` to start adding content. It will redirect you to `CMS` tab where you can manage content for that extension.

<p class="image">
<img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/img/getting-started/empty-cms.png'/>
</p>

Click on `Add item`. This will open a modal for inserting data for `Restaurants` model, which you defined with your Data Schema.

<p class="image">
<img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/img/getting-started/cms-modal.png'/>
</p>

Add some restaurants to the admin page.

<p class="image">
<img src='{{ site.baseurl }}/img/getting-started/full-cms.png'/>
</p>

Although you've added them, your extension is still using static data. Let's go to fetch the data from Shoutem Cloud Storage using `@shoutem/redux-io` package.
